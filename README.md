# 🐞 Software Bug Prediction using Semi-Supervised Learning

This project implements a semi-supervised learning approach to predict software bugs using the KC1 defect dataset from the PROMISE repository. It combines ensemble models with pseudo-labeling to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, improving prediction performance under limited supervision.

---

## 🚀 Overview

- Developed a **semi-supervised machine learning pipeline** to detect defects in software modules.
- Applied **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance and **StandardScaler** for feature normalization.
- Used **Random Forest feature importance** for feature selection, achieving 88% accuracy on selected features.
- Combined **Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Logistic Regression** in a soft-voting ensemble.
- Employed **iterative pseudo-labeling** with confidence thresholds (0.80–0.90) and **early stopping** based on validation F1-score stagnation.

## 🗂 Dataset

- **KC1** defect dataset from the [PROMISE repository](http://promise.site.uottawa.ca/SERepository/datasets-page.html)
- Preprocessing steps:
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature normalization
  - Binary classification based on `defects` field

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Preprocessing**  
   Normalize and balance data using `StandardScaler` and `SMOTE`.

2. **Feature Selection**  
   Use Random Forest importance scores to select top predictors.

3. **Model Training**  
   Train ensemble on labeled samples using soft-voting.

4. **Pseudo-labeling**  
   Add confidently predicted unlabeled samples (≥ threshold) to the training set iteratively.

5. **Early Stopping**  
   Monitor validation F1; stop if no improvement in 3 epochs.

6. **Evaluation**  
   Assess final model using test set performance metrics.
